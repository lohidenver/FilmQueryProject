Lessons Learned

I worked several days on this project and still failed to get it to work.  
I suffered through migraines during the instruction and then again when the project was given out.  
I am still learning the skills but have not yet completed competency.
I am struggling and have again sought some outside help to help me catch up.
I know I am close but I just am not there.  
This course is really fast and when I miss two days of instruction it really affects me.  It is almost like a snowball effect.
